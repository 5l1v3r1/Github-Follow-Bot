# GitHub Follow Bot

Started as a fork, completely changed around code. **I do not recommend you use this a lot, you may get banned from GitHub but I'm not sure! This was just a PoC**

## Installing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

#### To Follow:

```
python follow_bot.py -t <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> -m <YOUR_USERNAME> -u <TARGET_TO_GRAB_FOLLOWERS_FROM> # To follow and generate a new followers file.

python follow_bot.py -t <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> -m <YOUR_USERNAME> -f <FILENAME> # Follow users from a pre-generated file

python follow_bot.py -t <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> -m <YOUR_USERNAME> -mf 1000 # Cap followers to 1000
```

#### To Unfollow:

```
python unfollow_bot.py -t <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> -m <YOUR_USERNAME> -f <FILENAME> # Unfollow users from file.
```

## Why I did this?

Selenium is slow and ugly, APIs are nice to use and we can let this run in the background. Also allows for less resources to be used + storing files of who you followed so you don't lose people you really do want to follow!

Somewhere, I read:
- One in ten people you follow will follow you back.
- One in hundred people you follow will star your repos.
- One in thousand people you follow will fork your repos.

Might be true, might be not ü§∑‚Äç.
